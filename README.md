python-excel-date-standardizer
==============================

Small lib to quick return a standardized date from excel date.

This works just with xlrd objects.

If you won't need to compare dates you won't need this probably.

thw workbook argument is a Workbook istance of xlwt.Workbook.

You need xlrd and xlwt to make it work.

Cheers
